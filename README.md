[![CI Gate](https://github.com/tkarakai/web-app-starter/actions/workflows/ci-gate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tkarakai/web-app-starter/actions/workflows/ci-gate.yml)

A production-shaped monorepo starter that wires Bun, Turborepo, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Convex, and Better Auth into a ready-to-extend foundation. It includes six Next.js apps, shared packages for UI, auth, backend, i18n, and rate limiting, and a comprehensive testing and CI setup.

## What this starter gives you

- **Monorepo** powered by Bun workspaces + Turborepo for orchestration.
- **Six Next.js apps**: web (port 3001), admin (port 3002), landing (port 3000), landing-static (port 3004), storybook (port 3003), demo.
- **Shared packages**: UI (`@repo/design-system`), auth (`@repo/auth`), backend (`@repo/backend`), i18n (`@repo/i18n`), edge rate limiting (`@repo/edge-rate-limit`), design patterns (`@repo/design-patterns`).
- Convex for database, file storage, and API functions (queries/mutations/actions).
- Better Auth wired to Convex, including Next.js route handlers and client hooks.
- Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui styling with a bold, modern interface.
- Sample launch dashboard with realtime updates and file uploads.
- Multi-tier testing: Bun unit tests, Vitest component tests, Convex backend tests, Playwright E2E.
- Internationalization (15 languages including RTL) via `@repo/i18n` and `next-intl`.
- Local CI checks that mirror GitHub Actions, with offline Docker mode via `act`.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

2. Start the development environment:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts Convex and the core apps (web, admin, landing, storybook) in local anonymous mode. On first run, it creates a `.env.local` file with a deployment name derived from your directory path and seeds two test accounts:

| Account | Email | Password | Role |
|---------|-------|----------|------|
| Admin | `admin@admin.com` | `adminadmin` | admin |
| User | `user@user.com` | `useruser` | user |

These are created automatically via `devSeed` and persist across restarts. Subsequent runs skip seeding.

To start only a specific app:

```bash
bun run dev:web              # Convex + web app (port 3001)
bun run dev:admin            # Convex + admin app (port 3002)
bun run dev:landing          # Landing page only (port 3000, no Convex)
bun run dev:landing-static   # Static landing page (port 3004, no Convex)
bun run dev:storybook        # Component storybook (port 3003, no Convex)
```

3. Open the apps:
   - Web app: `http://localhost:3001`
   - Admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3002`
   - Landing page: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Landing static: `http://localhost:3004`
   - Storybook: `http://localhost:3003`

4. When you're done, stop everything:

```bash
bun run dev:stop
```

5. Check status of running services:

```bash
bun run dev:status
```

### Branch and worktree isolation

Each git branch or worktree gets its own independent Convex deployment automatically. The deployment name is derived from the working directory path, so:

- **Main repo on `main` branch**: `web-app-starter` deployment
- **Worktree for `feature-x`**: `web-app-starter-feature-x` deployment
- **Separate clone in different folder**: Different deployment based on that path

Each deployment has its own:
- Database with separate tables and data
- File storage
- Environment variables (set via `bunx convex env set`)

This means you can switch branches or work in multiple worktrees simultaneously without data conflicts.

### Offline development

The local Convex backend runs entirely on your machine—no internet connection required. Data persists in `~/.convex/anonymous-convex-backend-state/<deployment-name>/` between sessions.

### Better Auth auto-configuration

On the first run for a new deployment, the startup script automatically:
- Generates a `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and sets it in Convex
- Configures `SITE_URL` to match your Next.js URL

These values persist in the local Convex backend between sessions.

## Run against cloud Convex + Better Auth

1. Create a Convex project in the Convex dashboard and grab the deployment URLs:
   - `https://<deployment>.convex.cloud` (API)
   - `https://<deployment>.convex.site` (site proxy)
2. Set your local `.env.local` to the cloud values:

```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:<your-deployment>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.site
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-app-domain.com
```

3. Configure Convex env vars for that deployment:

```bash
bunx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET $(openssl rand -base64 32)
bunx convex env set SITE_URL https://your-app-domain.com
```

Important: Better Auth validates request origins. If you are running the app locally
but pointing to a cloud Convex deployment, add localhost to trusted origins:

```bash
bunx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS "http://localhost:3001,https://your-app-domain.com"
```

4. Run `bunx convex dev` and select the cloud deployment when prompted (or use the deployment configured in `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`).
5. Start the Next.js app: `bun run dev:web` or deploy to your hosting provider.

Notes:
- Better Auth data lives inside the same Convex deployment, so there is no separate auth database to provision.
- The `SITE_URL` Convex env var must match your app URL for auth redirects to work.

## Sample functionality

- Launch items are stored in Convex and stream into the dashboard in realtime.
- File uploads use Convex storage and show uploaded assets immediately.
- Better Auth sessions are used in both the client UI and server-side checks.

## Tests

Run tests via Turborepo (from the project root):

```bash
bun run test            # Bun unit tests (across all workspaces)
bun run test:unit       # Vitest component tests
bun run test:convex     # Convex backend tests
bun run test:e2e        # Playwright E2E tests
bun run test:all        # All of the above
```

> **WARNING**: Always use `bun run test` (with `run`), never bare `bun test`. Bare `bun test` picks up all test files and fails because some require Vitest's DOM environment.

Run the full CI check before pushing:

```bash
bun run ci              # Full CI: lint, types, tests, build, e2e
bun run ci:quick        # Skip E2E for faster feedback
bun run ci:act          # Run in Docker via act (mirrors GitHub Actions)
bun run ci:act:offline  # Offline mode (fast, no network required)
```

## Conventions

### Coding
- Keep server/client boundaries explicit. Client components include `"use client"`.
- Use Convex for all APIs (queries/mutations/actions). Next.js API routes are only for auth proxying.
- Prefer small, composable components with single responsibilities.
- Import shared packages by name: `@repo/design-system`, `@repo/auth/client`, `@repo/backend`.
- UI components live in `@repo/design-system`. App-specific components live in `apps/<app>/src/components/`.

### Testing
- Bun unit tests for pure functions and utilities (`apps/web/qa/tests/*.test.ts`).
- Vitest for React component tests (`apps/web/qa/tests/*.test.tsx`).
- convex-test for backend functions (`packages/backend/convex/*.test.ts`).
- Playwright for E2E flows (`apps/web/qa/e2e/*.spec.ts`).

### Documentation
- Update README sections when changing core architecture or workflows.
- Document any new environment variables in `.env.example`.
- Keep component-level comments brief and focused on non-obvious behavior.

### DevOps
- Use Convex deployments for environment-specific configuration.
- Keep secrets in Convex env vars, never in committed files.
- CI runs via Turborepo: `turbo lint`, `turbo typecheck`, `turbo build`, etc.

## Local vs cloud deployments

### Convex data and files

- Local: `bun run dev` runs a local Convex backend in anonymous mode. Data and file storage persist in `~/.convex/anonymous-convex-backend-state/<deployment-name>/`. Each branch or worktree gets its own isolated deployment. The supported way to access local data is through Convex queries/mutations (your app or admin-only functions).
- Cloud: data and files live in Convex-managed cloud storage. Use the Convex dashboard and deployment tooling to inspect or export data.

### Better Auth data

- Local: Better Auth stores users, sessions, and credentials inside the same local Convex deployment via the Better Auth component. There is no separate local auth database.
- Cloud: the same tables live in the Convex cloud deployment for that environment.

### Where user data lives (and how to manage it)

- Better Auth user data is stored inside the Better Auth Convex component, not in your app tables.
- In the Convex dashboard, switch to the component data view for `betterAuth` to inspect users, sessions, and accounts.
- For management, build admin-only Convex functions that call `authComponent` APIs or Better Auth server APIs.

### Environment differences

- Local env uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` pointing to localhost ports. Ports are dynamically assigned per deployment and automatically updated in `.env.local` by `bun run dev`.
- Cloud env uses `https://<deployment>.convex.cloud` (API) and `https://<deployment>.convex.site` (site proxy).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and the Convex `SITE_URL` env var should match your app URL for each environment.

## Convex workflow primer

Use this mental model to avoid surprises when switching between local and cloud.

### Fully local

- Run: `bun run dev` (or `bun run dev:web` for just the web app)
- Convex starts a local backend in anonymous mode and syncs your local functions/schema into it.
- The app automatically points at the correct local ports (dynamically assigned).
- Changes apply immediately because the local backend is the one you are using.
- Stop with: `bun run dev:stop`

### Hybrid (local app + cloud Convex)

- Your app points to cloud URLs (`https://<deployment>.convex.cloud`).
- Local function/schema changes do nothing until you push them.
- Push options:
  - Run `bunx convex dev` targeting the cloud deployment (live sync).
  - Or run `bunx convex deploy` when you want to push changes.

### Fully cloud

- App and Convex are both deployed.
- Use `bunx convex deploy` (often in CI) for changes.

### Mental model

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` = where your app sends requests.
- `bun run dev` (local) / `bunx convex deploy` (cloud) = how local code is pushed to that backend.

## Environment conventions

This repo does not enforce a naming scheme, but the following conventions are clear and common:

- Fully local (app + Convex local): `.env.local` (managed automatically by `bun run dev`)
- Hybrid (app local + Convex cloud): `.env.cloud`
- Fully cloud (app + Convex cloud): `.env.production` (or provider env vars)

### Example: fully local

```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=anonymous:<deployment-name>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<cloud-port>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<site-port>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Note: `bun run dev` automatically manages these values. Ports are dynamically assigned per deployment.

### Example: hybrid (local app + cloud Convex)

```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:<deployment>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.site
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Example: fully cloud

```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:<deployment>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://<deployment>.convex.site
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://app.example.com
```
